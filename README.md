# rareSkill-system
I am currently enrolled in RareSkills bootcamp and this repo is for the projects I make while I'm at it.

TODO:
- Add natspec for all the complex functions
- Create readme for week 3 folder
- reorder functions by visibility
- check attacks to v2 to make sure my version works against that

Corner cases to watch out for:

- What considerations do you need in your fixed point library? How much of a token with 18 decimals can your contract store?

## Recommended Reading Afterwards
